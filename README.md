Starting an adventure with words, I created the Dictionary Project that opens up a world of knowledge with just a few clicks. During the SheCodes React Add-On Workshop spanning two weeks, I immersed myself in the art of crafting interactive web applications.

Armed with React, Bootstrap, and the magic of APIs, I brought the power of a dictionary to the digital realm. Now, anyone can effortlessly explore the meanings of words they're curious about. With a simple search, my app displays the word's definition, phonetics to help with pronunciation, and even provides an audio clip to hear the word spoken aloud. It also showcases synonyms and offers a visual treat. I integrated photos related to each looked-up word, transforming the experience into a multi-sensory adventure.

Technologies employed:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript / React
- API integration
